# RxProxy

RxProxy is a simple way of creating Observables that can be fed values in a non-reactive way.

### Build Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/upday/RxProxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/upday/RxProxy) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/upday/RxProxy/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/upday/RxProxy?branch=master)

## Usage
Declare `RxProxy` as a member variable:

    private final RxProxy<String> mTextStream = RxPublishProxy.create();
    

Publish on the proxy:

    private void changeText(final String text) {
        mTextStream.publish(text);
    }

Subscribe for the changes:

    mTextStream.asObservable(Schedulers.computation())
               .filter(this::isValidText)
               .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
               .subscribe(mTextView::setText);
    
## Issues with Subjects
Subjects are really useful, but we have noticed two issues with them:

* Publication and subscription do happen on the same thread. It does not matter if you are using `subscribeOn`. The subscription will be executed on the same thread from which `onNext` was called. This can be mitigated with `observeOn` but it changes the original pattern of the monad. `RxProxy` requires subscribers to define which `Scheduler` is used when receiving events from the proxy.
* One can get confused when using `onComplete` and `onError`. Those can leave Subjects in a unusable state without making the user aware. In `RxProxy` a stream cannot be finished or report an error on its own. `RxProxy` just contains a `publish` method that is the equivalent of `onNext`.
* Most Subjects do not support back-pressure. They immediately report an error whenever more items are delivered than requested. In `RxProxy`, each implementation has a small dedicated buffer that in the future we can control.

## Credits
The idea for the project was inspired by reading a great series of blogs on [RxJava](http://akarnokd.blogspot.de/) by  [DÃ¡vid Karnok](https://plus.google.com/113316559156085910174/posts).
