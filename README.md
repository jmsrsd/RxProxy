# RxProxy

RxProxy is a simple way of creating observables that can be feed values in a non-reactive way.
As you might know, in the Rx way, Subjects are used mostly for this propose.
However, they are affected bu some problems that RxProxy wants to resolve.

### Build Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/upday/RxProxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/upday/RxProxy) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/upday/RxProxy/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/upday/RxProxy?branch=master)

## Usage
Declare `RxProxy` as a member variable.

    private final RxProxy<String> mTextStream = RxPublishProxy.create();
    

Publish on the proxy.

    private void changeText(final String text) {
        mTextStream.publish(text);
    }

Subscribe for the changes.

    mTextStream.asObservable(Schedulers.computation())
               .filter(String::isEmpty)
               .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
               .subscribe(mTextView::setText);
    
## Issues with Subjects
Subjects are really useful, but we have noticed two issues with them:

* Publication and subscription do happen on the same thread. It does not matter if you are using `subscribeOn`. The subscription will be executed on the same thread as `onNext` was called. This can be mitigated with `observeOn` but is changes the original pattern of the monad.
* One can get confused when using `onComplete` and `onError`. Those can leave subjects in a unusable state without making the user aware. In our aproach a stream cannot be finished or report an error on it's own.

## Credits
The idea for the project has been lit after reading a great series of blogs [on RxJava by DÃ¡vid Karnok](http://akarnokd.blogspot.de/).
